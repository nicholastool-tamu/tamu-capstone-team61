Plans for this week (9/17-9/24):

I figured out the exact tools I will be using to create the server, such as Apache and MariaDB. I began running tests to ensure the Raspberry Pi is functioning correctly
My plan is to finish running tests to make sure the Raspberry Pi is fully functional, and then begin to build the local host and database.
Our team plan is to start working on the FSR and ICD, as well as get ready for our first project demo approaching next week.

Plans for this week (9/24-10/1):

I created the LAMP server last week on the Raspberry Pi, and tested the basic functions of the server.
My plan is to do some research on what I want to use for back-end API development. I am looking into both Django and Flask for this, but am going to solidify this choice and install it so I can begin to work on the back-end.
Our team plan is to finish up the FSR and ICD which are due this Thursday, and then meet with our sponsor to discuss our progress.

Plans for this Week (10/1-10/8)
I have solidified my plans for back-end developmenmt, and I am going to use PHP for the API due to ease of connectivity with other programs and systems, which will make it easier for us to link everything in the future
My plan is to start validation testing the database and host to make sure that it is working as expected on a basic level, and also add in any code or parts to the database and host that may appear as needed.
