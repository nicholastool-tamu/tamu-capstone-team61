So far I have been learning about Kotlin and Android Studio. 
My initial projrect is to create a basic android app. So far I have
messed around with layouts and started practing how to assign functions
to various on screen items. I have an app that can navigate from page 
to page with buttons. 

Looking forward
I will get the layouts looking better and include more functionality. I will
Research how to take information from a database and populate the pages with it.
