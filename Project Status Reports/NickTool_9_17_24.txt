Plans for this week:

I figured out the exact tools I will be using to create the server, such as Apache and MariaDB. I began running tests to ensure the Raspberry Pi is functioning correctly
My plan is to finish running tests to make sure the Raspberry Pi is fully functional, and then begin to build the local host and database.
Our team plan is to start working on the FSR and ICD, as well as get ready for our first project demo approaching next week.
